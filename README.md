# Global_Warming_Analysis

The Earth is in a constant state of climate change. 
Earth has experienced many cycles of global warming and cooling. 
The warm and cold periods can last from thousands to millions of years.
Right now, many scientists who study environmental sciences believe the climate is warming. 
The Earth's temperature has increased by one degree Fahrenheit in the last hundred years. This may seem like a very tiny change, but even a tiny change in the climate has huge consequences.
